## Description

The Musical Moods App allows users to search for a song by title and artist. The app will return the title of the album the song was on and an image of the album cover. It will also return an image that represents the "mood" of the song, based on the valence measure provided by the Spotify API map. Valence is consiered to be the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. The images will range from a very happy face to a very unhappy face, corresponding to the Valence number the API assigns to the track.
